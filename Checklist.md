THINGS TO DO:

- Hook up HTML page to Graph.java
  - Draw path on map with HTML5 canvas
  - Integrate other two databases with the forms (currently only checks Menards table)
  - Polish results page and make it look not barebones and ugly
  - Autocomplete filter
  - What if the product you want isn't in database? Do some input validation
  - Still some bugs. More than one item crashes TSP.
